<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Desalination Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In desalination plants, pumps are crucial for efficient water extraction and processing. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water, making them ideal for large volume applications and high flow rates, often used in the initial intake stages. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, operate by trapping a fixed amount of water and displacing it, providing consistent flow regardless of pressure conditions. Each type serves distinct roles in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of desalination processes.</p></p>
