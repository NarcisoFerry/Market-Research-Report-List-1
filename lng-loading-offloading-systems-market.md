<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Loading & Offloading Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CBM (Conventional Buoy Mooring)</li><li>SPM (Single Point Mooring)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LNG loading and offloading systems include two primary types: Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM) and Single Point Mooring (SPM). CBM systems involve a buoy that allows ships to moor without using anchors, facilitating efficient loading and unloading of LNG. In contrast, SPM systems enable a vessel to rotate freely around a mooring point, accommodating varying weather conditions and enhancing safety. Both systems are crucial for optimizing LNG transfer operations and minimizing environmental impacts in the energy sector.</p></p>
