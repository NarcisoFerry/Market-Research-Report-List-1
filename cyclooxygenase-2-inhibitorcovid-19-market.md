<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 InhibitorCOVID 19 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are drugs that reduce inflammation and pain by selectively targeting the COX-2 enzyme. In the COVID-19 market, COX-2 inhibitors can be categorized into selective and non-selective types. Selective COX-2 inhibitors specifically block the COX-2 enzyme while sparing COX-1, potentially reducing gastrointestinal side effects. Non-selective COX-2 inhibitors inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, addressing broader inflammation but with higher risk of side effects. Both types are being explored for their potential benefits in managing COVID-19 related inflammation.</p></p>
