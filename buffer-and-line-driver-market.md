<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buffer and Line Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Three States</li><li>Open Drain</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The buffer and line driver market can be categorized into three states: active, inactive, and tri-state modes. Active mode drives signals while inactive mode disconnects output. Tri-state allows the output to be high impedance, enabling multiple outputs to share a line without interference. Open-drain configuration is typically used for interfacing with multiple devices on a single bus, allowing for easy connection and communication among them. This setup helps manage high-speed data transfer and reduce signal contention in digital circuits.</p></p>
