<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Reinforced Grating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Molding Type</li><li>Extrusion Molding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass Reinforced Grating (FRP) is categorized mainly into two types based on its manufacturing process: Compression Molding and Extrusion Molding. Compression Molding involves placing resin and fiberglass into a mold, then applying heat and pressure to form shaped grating, offering high strength and precise designs suitable for various applications. Extrusion Molding, on the other hand, forces the resin and fiberglass mixture through a die to create long, continuous grating sections, ideal for large-scale projects needing consistent profiles and ease of installation.</p></p>
