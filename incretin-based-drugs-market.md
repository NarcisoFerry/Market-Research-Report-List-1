<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Incretin-Based Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists</li><li>Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Incretin-based drugs are essential for managing type 2 diabetes, focusing on enhancing insulin secretion and lowering blood glucose levels. The two main types are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1 agonists stimulate insulin release, slow gastric emptying, and promote satiety, while DPP-4 inhibitors block the enzyme that deactivates incretin hormones, increasing their availability and effectiveness. Together, they provide diverse options for glycemic control and weight management in diabetic patients.</p></p>
