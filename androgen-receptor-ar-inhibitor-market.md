<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steroids</li><li>Nonsteroidal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibitor market is primarily divided into two types: steroidal and non-steroidal inhibitors. Steroidal AR inhibitors, derived from steroid compounds, function by binding to androgen receptors and blocking testosterone's effects, often used in hormone-sensitive conditions like prostate cancer. Non-steroidal inhibitors, on the other hand, are synthetic compounds that obstruct androgen receptor activity without structural similarity to steroids. Both types are crucial in managing androgen-related disorders and are employed based on specific therapeutic needs.</p></p>
